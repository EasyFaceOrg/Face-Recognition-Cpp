# Face-Recognition-Cpp

### Introduction

- Detect: Fast-MTCNN
- Verification: MobileFaceNet + Arcface

This project is using Fast-MTCNN for face detection and TVM inference model for face recognition. At the face detection stage, the the module will output the `x,y,w,h` coordinations as well as `5` facial landmarks for further alignment. At the face recognition stage, the `112x112` image crop by the first stage output will be the second stage input. The output will be an `1x128` feature vector for cosine similarity measuring. 

### Set up:

- **Require OpenCV**

```shell
brew install opencv
brew link opencv
brew install pkg-config
pkg-config --cflags --libs /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/<version_number>/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc
```

- **Require [TVM](https://docs.tvm.ai/install/from_source.html#python-package-installation)**

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/tvm

mkdir build
cp cmake/config.cmake build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

- **About the .os file**

Now Linux users can replace the model files with those inside folder `model/linux`

- **CMakeList.txt**

  `modify the TVM path into your own `

- **Prefix:** set the prefix model path to your own.

- **Recording ground truth:**`mkdir img` and set record to `1` to record ground truth image for face recognition.

### Run:

Run the project may activate your camera to capture images.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
./FaceRecognitionCpp
```

### Output Structure:

```c++
struct _FaceInfo {
    int face_count;
    double face_details[][15];
} faceinfo;
```

Score port: 0

Bbox port: 1~5

Landmark port: 6~14

### **Tun-able Parametersï¼š**

1. **minSize:** set the minimum size of faces for MTCNN detector. Larger size can ensure quick inference time.
2. **factor:** set the step factor for pyramid of image.  Larger factor will get fewer images after doing pyramid.
3. **Frame size:** set the camera or streaming capturing frame size.
4. **Stage:** set how many stage for MTCNN to implement.
5. **Average Faces:** default 1 



### #TODO

- Quantize arcface model
